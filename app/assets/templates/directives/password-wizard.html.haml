                Changing your password involves changing your encryption key, which requires your data to be re-encrypted and synced.
                If you have many items, syncing your data can take several minutes.

                A new update is available for your account. Updates address improvements and enhancements to our security specification.
                This process will guide you through the update, and perform the steps necessary with your supervision.

                As a result of this process, the entirety of your data will be re-encrypted and synced to your account. This is a generally safe process,
                but unforeseen factors like poor network connectivity or a sudden shutdown of your computer may cause this process to fail.
                It's best to be on the safe side before large operations such as this one.
