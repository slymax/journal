This is a fork of [Standard Notes](https://github.com/standardnotes/web), optimized for journaling. It's essentially Standard Notes except that it

- only allows one entry per day.
- removes everything that isn't necessary for journaling.
- adds an "on this day" feature that allows you to travel back in time by showing only entries that have been written on the same day of the year. Simply enter `today` in the search bar. This also works with offsets like `today+1` or `today-5`.
